Take-Home Project
Overview
This take-home project is designed to give us a better understanding of your skillset and skill level. The
initial interview gave us a general sense, but this take-home project provides an opportunity to better
evaluate:
• How organized, clear and thought-out your code and project structure are
• How you learn technologies, processes and concepts with which you are not familiar
• How you work on projects that resemble what you would be working on day-to-day
• The considerations you took when designing the solution
Tech Stack
This project will involve the following key components:
1. ReactJS
2. Django + Django REST Framework
3. PostgreSQL
4. A 3rd-party API
Instructions
In a maximum of seven days, build a small full-stack application using the previously outlined Tech
Stack and utilize one of the free public APIs in this list: https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis.
The application should perform the following:
• The ReactJS front-end should request a list of records from the Django + Django REST
Framework back-end
• The Django + Django REST Framework back-end should check if records exist in PostgreSQL:
o If they do, it should return the list to the ReactJS front-end
o If they do not, it should get a list of records from the 3rd-party API, save them to
PostgreSQL, and return the list to the ReactJS front-end
• The ReactJS front-end should render the list and indicate if they came from the API or
PostgreSQL
• In addition, the list elements should be able to be selected and by doing so will render the
details of that record and indicate whether they came from the API or PostgreSQL
When you have finished, please push to a personal code repository and notify The Croner Company.
We will then schedule a call to review the project with you.
Much of the knowledge for successfully completing this project should be covered in the
"Getting Started," or "Tutorial," type documentation for the tech involved.
Please don't hesitate to reach out if the details are not clear or if you have any questions.

What We Are Looking For
At a minimum, we would like to see:
• A functioning application without console errors, bugs and with consistent formatting
• Clear coding style consistent with style guide, or convention, for the language, library or
framework
• Best practices being followed for the language, library, or framework
• Tests
• Documentation for how to run the application
Please feel free to take any other liberties if time permits--it is encouraged!
